# When you see this, do that instead!
 This is a youtube video i am watching for now atleast by Raymond Hettinger. The title of this viedo is "Transmoring code into beautiful, idiomatic python"

 ## When you see this, do that instead!
- Replace traditional index manipulation with Python's core looping idioms
- Learn advances techniques with for-else clauses and the two arguments form iter()
- improve your craftmanship and aim for clean fast, idiomatic python code
