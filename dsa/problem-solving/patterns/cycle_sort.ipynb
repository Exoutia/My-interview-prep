    "#### Theory\n",
    "The cycle sort algo is an in-place sorting algorithm. This means that no external data structure is required to perform the cycle sort operation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The underlying assumption for the algo is that an unsorted list is similar to a graph, where nodes are connected with edges. We can assume that a relation between nodes `a` and `b` exists if -- in order to sort the array-- the element present at node `a` should be at index of node `b`.\n",

    "3. Replace the element at the current index with the element at the index number found in step 2.<br>For the instance, in step 2 the number of elements that are smaller than 9 was 4 thus number 9 was swaped with number at index at 4 i.e. 14. <br> `[9, 4, 6, 8, 14, 3] --> [14, 4, 6, 8, 9, 3]`\n",
    "4. Now again we compare the element at current index with all the remaining elements, (14 is compared and we got that its greater than 5 elements) and then we agian replace the current number with the element at index as the number of smaller elements. (so we swap the element 14 with element at index 5 in array)<br>`[14, 4, 6, 8, 9, 3] --> [3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14]`\n",
